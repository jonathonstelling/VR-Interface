Template for using Keyshot VR with many different settings/configurations loaded into one iFrame space

Examples: Exploded Views, Colours, Setups, etc..

This example doesn't change the source of the iFrame to prevent the VR images been loaded in every time a new configuration is shown on the page,
this reduces the amount of data used. Instead, this example simply hides and shows the different iFrame configurations. With inline styling.
